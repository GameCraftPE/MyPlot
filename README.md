### **Create, manage, and build in protected plots! Keep your builds safe from griefers!**

#### Please note that the [API3](https://github.com/jasonwynn10/MyPlot/tree/API3) Branch is currently under heavy development for the new changes in pmmp 1.0 and may not work 100% of the time. The master branch is for compatability with 0.16 clients.

Have you ever seen those PC servers with the PlotMe plugin and thought "Hey, why can't I have plots on my MCPE server?" Well, now you can with **MyPlot** for PocketMine-MP! 
#### Current Features:
 - Easy to set up and simple to use!
 - Simple commands for all your plot needs
 - Multiple methods to save your plot data
 - Customizable permissions to set the amount of plots a player can have
 - Multiple plot worlds are supported!

A list of commands and permissions can be found in the [MyPlot Wiki](http://jasonwynn10.github.io/MyPlot/cmdsandperms) along with a helpful config guide [here](http://jasonwynn10.github.io/MyPlot/configurations).

Want to help create language resource packs? If you know a language that is not created yet, you can create a new language pack by opening a pull request! If the language you know is already created, you can help improve it by editing it! Many of the current resource packs are outdated anyway :P

###### *NOTE:* MyPlot is designed to only support pmmp's version PocketMine-MP.
